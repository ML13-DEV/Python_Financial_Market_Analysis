# 📈 Financial Market Analysis – Python - SQL -Matplotlib - Seaborn

This project focuses on analyzing daily stock price data obtained through a public API and stored inside a MySQL database.
Using Python, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and Seaborn, I built a small analytics pipeline capable of:

- Fetching and storing daily stock data

- Performing SQL-based financial queries

- Calculating daily returns, volatility, and correlations

- Generating visual insights from market behavior

- The goal of this project is to provide a clean, reproducible structure for financial data analysis and to demonstrate practical experience working with APIs, SQL, and Python’s data stack.

## 🧠 Main Features  
### ✔️ Data Acquisition

- Retrieves historical stock prices using the AlphaVantage API

- Supports multiple stock symbols

- Allows full or compact datasets (based on API limits)

### ✔️ Database Integration

- Saves all downloaded data into a MySQL table (stock_info)

- Uses to_sql() for efficient, chunked insertion

- SQL queries are centralized in stats_functions.py

### ✔️ Financial Analytics

Includes metrics such as:

- Daily Returns (percentage change of closing prices)

- Daily & Yearly Moving Volatility (20D, 40D, 60D, 80D, 100D windows)

- Company Correlation Matrix

- Monthly Volume Aggregation

### ✔️ Visualizations

Created using Seaborn & Matplotlib:

- Monthly trading volume

- Daily returns timeline

- Daily & yearly volatility comparison

- Return distribution histograms

- Correlation heatmaps
